# MovieReviewFinalProject
MovieReview is an application where people can find all the data related to movies.
It is a full stack webapp built using django-rest framework.
To use the application, one must login with their account created using signup.
Later , they need to search the movie for which they need details. Then you can see the details of the movie :-)
You can search as many movies as you want.
At any cost, you cant access the search withount login and we have an authentication for that.
After the searches are over , you can just log out and log yourself out of the site and leave.
